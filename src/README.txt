1. Overview

	This document explains the Orion Tool system requirement and its usage.

2. System Requirements

	- Linux system with Python2.7.6 or later installed.
        - This package has dependency on following Python packages
           i.   httplib2
           ii.  json
           iii. xml.etree.cElementTree
        - Linux system and Orion Manager should be in same subnet and should
          be reachable.

	Note: orion_tool.py has been tested on Python2.7.6 version, but should work
	      for later versions of Python2.7.x. It doesn't support Python3.x

3. Orion Tool Installation and Usage

	The Orion tool is in PyOrionDevClient-<version>.tgz format

	3.1 Orion Tool Installation

		Move the PyOrionDevClient-<version>.tgz file to a location where it needs to
		be installed. Untarring the PyOrionDevClient-<version>.tgz file installs the 
                tool in the current working directory.

		$tar -xzf PyOrionDevClient-<version>.tgz

	3.2 Orion Tool Usage

		Before executing the tool, change the current directory to,
		'./PyOrionDevClient-<version>/src'

		Command Syntax
		$python<X>.<Y> orion_tool.py [-h] -s <orion manager ip> [-d <stream destination ip>] [-i <stream source ip>] [-p <stream port>] [-m <profile name>] [-t <interval>] [-l] [-f <profile id>] 

		-h or --help
			To know the help on this tool
	
		-s or --omip <Mandatory parameter>
                        Orion Manager IP Address. This is required to connect
                        orion manager to perform various tasks.                        

		-d or --sdip <Optional parameter>
                        To scan specific feed with destination ip address of stream. 
                        This parameter must be used along with port number 
                        ("-p <port #>") option.
 
		-i or --ssip <Optional parameter>
                        Stream source ip address. Optional parameter to give along 
                        with "-d" and "-p" to scan the specific feed.

		-p or --sport <Optional parameter>
		        Stream destination port number to scan specific feed.
                        This option must be used along with -d (dest address) option.

                -m or --mprof <Optional parameter>
	                Profile name. Tool will monitor the stream based on this 
                        profile name.
 
                -t or --inter <Optional parameter>
                        Duration (in min) to Monitor Streams. The default
                        monitoring time is 5 minutes.

                -l or --lprof <Optional parameter>
                        Lists all available profiles. It will also show which 
                        profile is default profile with 'o' notation.

                -f or --sprof <Optional parameter>
                        To set default profile id. List the profile with "-l"
                        option to know profile ids. Tool will monitor the stream 
                        based on default profile.

		Example 1: Show help on tool.
			$python2.7 orion_tool.py -h

		Example 2: To scan feeds and start monitoring of all feeds for 10min.
			$python2.7 orion_tool.py -s 10.130.98.150 -t 10 

                Example 3: To scan and start monitoring of feed whose destination ip and port are
                           239.192.0.1 and 5004 respectively for 5min (default time).
			$python2.7 orion_tool.py -s 10.130.98.150 -d 239.192.0.1 -p 5004 

                Example 4: To scan feeds and start monitoing of all the feeds based on given profile
                           name
                        $python2.7 orion_tool.py -s 10.130.98.150 -m MyProfile
               
                Example 5: To set profile id 1 as default profile and list all profiles.
			$python2.7 orion_tool.py -s 10.130.98.150 -f 1 -l 


		Note: In above examples, it is considered that orion manager is running @10.130.98.150
                      sanning and monitoring of unicast specific feed is not supported in this version.

	3.4 Orion Tool Report
		The report generated by tool by default is placed as Report_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.pdf file
		under tool directory. The report is required to view in Acrobat Reader. The report will 
                be generated only if QoE score is less than the configured value.
